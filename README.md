# üìê Geometric Deep Learning @ MIPT

Welcome to the official repository for the **Geometric Deep Learning** course at the **Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology (MIPT)**. This repository contains lecture materials, code examples, assignments, and projects related to learning deep learning methods on non-Euclidean domains such as graphs and manifolds.
